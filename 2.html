    <p style="margin-top:45px;">A stylesheet that stores the overall style of a web document in advance.
       It helps maintain consistency across the document and reduces the need for detailed styling.
       Existing HTML has a lot of limitations in designing and modifying web documents in various ways.
     The style sheet is designed to compensate for this, and the standard of the style
     sheet is <strong><u>CSS</u></strong>.

     <p><br><br><br> Also known as a style sheet.
    When creating a web page using HTML, you need to specify every single
   font in the overall framework.However, if you save a web page's style (composing format)
     in advance, the contents of the entire page can be changed by changing only
     one element of the web page. Changes can be made at once, helping
      to maintain consistency across documents and reducing work time.
    Therefore, web developers can design the web with a richer design,
    and can freely select or change the font size, font, line spacing, background color,
      arrangement position, etc., and also make maintenance easy.
